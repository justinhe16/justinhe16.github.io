        <p> Hello Friends! This is my <u>stonks website</u> where I continually update my positions and my thoughts on the market. I will be keeping track of TWO accounts -- account one is a long term account with investments in longs and more fundamental plays, while account two is an agressive options-only account that does 50% long term plays and 50% mid/short term plays.

            </br>
          </br>
          I didn't really make any trades this day and ended up pretty even, with small $100 fluctations on both accounts! I did enter some trades for expectations
          of success next week though (set up) in my accounts through various debit spreads and butterflies in tickers <b> $TSLA, $BLNK, $RIDE </b> and others. No lessons learned today, but
          just exercising ~patience~.

          </br>
          Today my first account took a bit of a dip, around <b> -$1000 </b> worth of damage again, but again nothing I'm worreid about. Mostly just small accumulation
          of pullback days on various tickers. Will exit on a bright green day :) Started my #turtlegang plays by adding <b> $BIMI, $OBCI </b> on recommendation of
          Andy of LKS. I think I will transition completely into turtle gang style, because I can afford to be more aggressive.
          </br>
          </br>

          My second account did ok, experiencing a <b> -$200 </b> loss from various butterflies dying but somewhat recouperated by my LEAPs and covered calls. In fact my
          LEAPs did so well that my covered calls were forced to be bought back, which isn't ideal, but I will keep aggressively managing them so it's ok. Tomorrow I am excited because
          theta will pay me well tomorrow, due to the <b> covered call strategy </b>. I'm glad I can finally use my LEAPs for passive income! Additionally, I picked up more
          medium swing positions in a <b> $CRSR </b> debit spread. I exited various weekly butterflies and lottos. I feel way more confident in my month-out swings because of more time --
          although I have less profit potential, it tends to be more successful and if levraged right, it can be extremely powerful! I feel better about the profit potential of my portfolio because
          I am building long to medium term structures to keep it up :) Lessons learned continue though -- take profit fast on short term weekly things and have a tiny* bit more patience on medium swings.
          Stick to your thesis and get better at TA/FA.

          Today my first account took a bit of a dip, around <b> -$1000 </b> worth of damages. It was accumulation of various losers, but most of them are
          long term gainers so I'm not worried. I should have, however, sold some <b> $EDIT </b> when it went up a crazy amount yesterday; I can still take advantages of
          swings. Lesson learnt.
          </br>
          </br>

          My second account did poorly again, totaling about <b> -$1800 </b> in loses. Mixed in with some poor day trades, my butterflies took a big hit from down swings today;
          the biggest one was <b> $BLNK </b>. Lesson here is that I really should have scaled out more where I could have; yesterday I was up 100%+ on my position and only sold 1/6th.
          Lesson learnt to scale out more; don't get greedy, and 100% is a crazy value to exit at as well. However, my conviction on my play stays pretty strong, so I'm holding hard. We'll see
          how it goes. Additionally, I picked up debit spreads in <b> $PINS, $LMND </b> and various naked calls on weed, such as <b> $CRON, $ACB </b> and other tickers like <b> $ZNGA, $TWTR, $RIDE </b> and will
          practice the ~ art of holding ~. Two lessons I need to work on are <b> trusting my conviction on plays despite dips in %s </b> and <b> scaling in and scaling out, NON-GREEDILY. </b> To tomorrow! </body>

          </br>
          Today my first account stayed relatively flat, losing about <b> -$100 </b> on the day through various fluctations overtime. Nothing to worry about!
          </br>
          </br>

          My second account did super well, gaining nearly <b> +$1400 </b> as I step closer to my principal from Feb 1. A good chunk of my gains came from my
          leaps, in particular the <b> $MARA </b> leap that is getting crazy sympathy from the crypto bull run as of recent. Additionally, my very own <b> $BLNK butterfly </b>
          made a great chunk of change, as the underlying ticker popped off a whole <b> +10% </b> over the day. My butterfly is still on track to do well, and ideally I can hit
          the exact price target on Friday! We will see, and I plan to take (and have already taken) profit accordingly. I have also picked up and kept my positions in <b> $RIO, $PLUG,
            $TLRY, $GM, $SPCE, $AAPL, $TSLA </b> although none of them were too crazy; minor gains and losses here and there! Ideally they pop up soon, based on trends (specifically a mix of
            ascending triangles and volume strength, alongside other indicators). Looking forward to see these plays pop off assuming my theseses hold strong. Something I've learned is not to be
            phased by minor ups and downs but focus on your THESIS, and potential invalidation of the THESIS. Pick strong plays where strong conviction is present. To tomorrow!

            </br>
          </br>
          Today my first account DESTROYED IT. Growing <b> +$1500 </b> in one day, majority of gains came from pick ups in
          <b> $EDIT </b> and <b> $ABB </b> I took up earlier (last friday). Additionally, positions in <b> $HOL, $NPA, $TPGYW+ </b>
          netted good returns overall! Added some <b> $TTOO </b> as a recommendation -- a great company to pick up within the healthcare field with
          promising results of COVID-related treatment and tracing.
          </br>
          </br>

          My second account recovered a tiny bit after a horrific week -- decided to take it slow and steady from here on out, with a majority of my position
          being LEAPS and covered calls (60%) and the other 40% in cash and/or short term swings. I am focused on theta-neutral, high return, well researched plays
          and playing heavily into those -- "concentrated bets" as some traders might say. I will try to have a max of 4 to 5 positions at a time, so I can monitor them and
          adjust accordingly. After the weekend, I am up roughly <b> +$900 </b>, with big winners from my <b> $MARA </b> leap as well as short term plays in
          <b> $TLRY, $SPCE, $BLNK, $RIO </b>. Some of these names, especially <b> $BLNK </b> were fickle, so although I sold some of my position at a high profit (roughly 100%) it came back down
          for the rest of the day -- this in itself shows the importance of scaling out profits over time, in order to lock in some rather than none. Thankfully, I'm pretty confident in that
          $BLNK will hold the trend I am aiming for. I also added <b> $BABA, $NIO, $TSM </b> to my long term leaps on belief of their fundamental growth and success, as well as buying into
          <b> $TSLA, $GM </b> butterfly swings. Let's go!

            </br>
          </br>
          Today my first account did ok again, staying flat. Added on a <b> $EDIT </b> long LEAP position!
          </br>
          </br>

          My second account behaved as expected on open; big dump do to 4 out of 4 earnings plays MISSED. Never playing earnings again; only playing
          run ups to earnings now. I refuse to get burned anymore. OOPS! My account took a <b> -$2100 </b> loss, ending the week at a nearly <b> -20% </b> change.
          My losses were further excaberated by
          plays like <b> $PLUG, $TLRY </b> losses as well. Ultimately, this week was mix of bad luck and degen plays; definitely misplays on my part. Very
          gamble-like and not trading at all. I need to more disciplined about my trades. It also doesn't help I haven't built my long term portfolio at all due to
          fear of a rug pull. Theoretically, when the rug pull does happen, I'll be OK as most people will lose money and I won't because I don't have any super long
          positions! But this is purely timing the market and honestly, I'm missing out on a lot of gains due to this. I have no idea what will happen going forward and
          I could just be totally missing all this good good green day cash. I decided to start a small position in <b> $MARA </b> with a LEAP, kicking off this account's
          LEAPs section. I decided to do this because I believe <b> $MARA </b> won't go underwater if there is a rug pull; crypto sympathy plays can perhaps do well in
          bear markets too. Other than that, I am going to refocus myself and trade myself back up; this is only 1 of 4 weeks in February so I hope at least I can get back to my
          starting point :) A little sad but still optomistic. I actually started this account with $27,000 back in December and worked it all the way up to 38K so I am not completely
          devastated. I just gave back most of gains ... a bit sadge but what can you do. I will come out on top! (I hope). Going to rest and study up this weekend. Will recap on
          Sunday!

          </br>
          </br>

          My second account poorly AGAIN. ZZZZZ. I got hit with another <b> -$1000 </b> loss, with again the biggest loser the SPY hedge.
          I'm technically OK with losing money on that, but the theoretical big losers here were my alleged winnners -- even the stock market
          was bright green today, the tickers I chose decided to not give a fuck and go down, and those small losses added up. Big losers included
          <b> $SPCE, $TLRY, $BLNK, $PLUG </b>. On a TA basis these should be good but unfortunately luck was not on my side. I also picked up earnings plays on
          <b> $PTON, $SNAP, $DKNG, $U </b> based on market sentiment and they all went red AH -- im expecting to wake up to a blood red portfoolio tomorrow...
          some lessons learned including to not play earnings that often, and know that even if a company beats earnings expectations, it can still go down based on market value.
          It's always safer to play the RUN-UP to earnings and not the earnings themselves. A lot of these plays (that weren't the earnings) made sense and had good R:R so kind of
          just sad that a mix of bad luck really threw a wrench in my plans. I am expecting to end the week on this account roughly -15% to -20%, which is insane for a week. At least
          im getting paid next Friday! LOL. If I keep playing things "correctly" I should be able to come out on top in the long term. My monthly goal of +15%, or $44000, is getting
          farther out of view but I still believe we can do it; the month is still very young. Very discouraging as of today though.

          Today my first account did ok again, netting about <b> +$150 </b> gain on the day. Slow moving for most of my positions, but gains on <b> $ABB </b> carried me. Nothing
          new and crazy to report here! Just still waiting on a drop in the market to pick up new industries I'm eyeing! Pretty close to my monthly target already though!

          </br>
          </br>

          My second account poorly AGAIN, getting hit with a <b> -$2200 </b> loss on the day! Again, most of the losses were in the <b> $SPY </b> puts (glad I cut some of them, would have been more lost),
          <b> $GME </b> Puts, and <b> $MRNA </b> Puts. Today I've learned a couple of things; to not HOLD THE BAG and realize profits when they're up! For example, my <b> $GME </b> Put was up 200%+ yesterday but I figured with
          so much room for GME to drop, I held. But I should have recognized the inevitable theta crush and $GME hovering/holding at $100s. GUH moment. I should have at least scaled out some of my 6
          contracts. Additionally, I need to continue respecting the invalidated thesis idea. Silly me, still in Puts. Losing money in a hardcore green market. All good though, because I didn't
          levrage a lot of my position anyways, and am sitting 90% cash for my portfolio size. If anything, I am playing it extremely safe -- maybe a little too safe. I need to begin levraging more as well as
          respecting my plans. <b> PLAN your trade, then TRADE your plan! </b> Also, considering to go into <u> more debit spreads and butterflies </u> -- good R/R, no theta crush, and reduction of risk. The only downside is capping
          my potential gains, but to be honest, I've been mostly having small winners or losers; if I set up my debit spreads correctly, I should benefit from most gains maximally. Started to levrage more in this bull market
          by taking on debit spreads in <b> $TLRY, $SPCE, and $PLUG </b> and my first ever conjured-on-my-own <b> $BLNK </b> butterfly. To tomorrow!

          </br>
          Today my first account did pretty well , with gains of <b> +$1200 </b>. This mostly was attributed to an insane gain on my <b> $CCIV warrants </b> due to rumors of a Lucid merger!
          As a result those alone netted over 60%+ on the day. SPACs for the win! I also picked up a new long position in HOL, which is related to the space industry, a budding area with
          much room to grow. It already went up 10%+ for me!

          </br>
          </br>

          My second account did terribly, taking a roughly <b> -$1900 </b> loss on the day. My main losers were SPY Puts, which I was definitely overlevraged in. <b> I need to be able to be flexible
          and realize that when the market changes direction, I need to be fast to act and drop my thesis ASAP. </b> I need to create conditions in which my thesis is invalidated and then follow said
          plan to exit and plan to evaluate. In other words, I was too married to the idea of <b> $SPY </b> dropping and I didn't respect the math right in front of me. My day trades were OK, basically breakeven,
          on <b> $TLRY </b> and <b> $MRNA </b>. At the end of the day, although I lost money, I learned some valuable knowledge to work on the future!

          Today my first account flourished, with gains of <b> +$990 </b>, attributed to my ARK related holdings
          and other long term positions bringing in value as well, specifically <b> CCIV. </b> For this account, today I sold my ARK-related positions
          as I believe the entire market is entering a downtrend, so by selling my ARK positions I hope I captured/sold at a local top. This is also a good
          exit for me here so that way I can focus on reallocating into other industries as planned. No new positions were added in this account today.

          </br>
          </br>

          My second account did alright, taking a roughly <b> -$250 </b> loss on the day. My day trades which involved <b> $JMIA, $FUBO, $AMZN </b> actually did very well
          alongside some of the new swings I entered including <b> $MRNA, $SPY, $GME </b> puts netted some gains already as well. Most of my losses were from my medium-term
          butterflies, namely my SPY Put butterfly, as today SPY made a decent rebounce to the 377s area. As of today we are still bearish and respecting the downtrend. One thing
          I can work on is maintaining my conviction; today, I picked up $FUBO but ended up paper handing it for a small percentage gain because I thought I saw weakness in the name,
          but I could have accounted for that by studying $FUBO in previous sessions where it often demonstrates weakness early in the day and rallies later on. I missed out on many
          tendies as a result. My current positions include AMZN, LULU, and SPY for medium-term plays as well as some short term swing plays that include $SPY 369P for 2/3,
          $GME 20P, $MRNA 150P, $FSR 15.5C for 2/5, and $INO 18C for 2/12. Hoping to profit off of $AMZN earnings report as well as overall market downtrend soon!

            <p class="card-text">What's up party people! This is my ~ first post ~ on the justinhe.com/stonks site. Let's get started :)
            </br>
          </br>
          Starting off with my monthly goals, for my 1st account I hope to <b>rebalance and refocus</b> my positions in order to make my
          exposure cleaner and more intentful, rather than bleeding into a variety of diverse positions. My goals are to move away from my heavy position in ARKK
          and reposition in materials, financials, weed as those are expected to be strong hitters in 2021 under Biden's administration. Additionally, I want to sell
          covered calls on these LEAPS. I may also want to dedicate 25% to 50% of this portfolio to the Wycoff accumulation trading strategy but I'm not fully decided;
          I'll make the call when I finish repositioning! Ideally, my goal for the end of the month of February is to hit ~10% mark on this account, so <b> $47124.00 </b>.
                      </br>
          </br>
          With my second account, I will be playing more aggressively. Currently, I am in some AMZN and LULU spreads, recommended by my mentor at LKS, and a SPY put spread, in anticpation for a correction.
          My goal after these resolve is to also rebalance and reposition into aggressive LEAPs and sell covered calls on those. Some of the growth tickers I am looking at are
          <b> TSM, NIO, BABA, CRON, GM, GRWG </b> which are high-growth, high-risk value stock. Additionally, I plan to continue adding my swing positions in <b> RIO, SRPT </b> as well as
          attempting various swing and day trades at <b> SLV, FUBO </b>. Ideally, my goal for the end of February is to hit a ~15% mark on this account, so roughly <b> $44000.00 </b>.
                      </br>
          </br>
          My day-of-the-week updates will be more specific and go indepth for each play I made that day -- thanks for following along and I hope you can learn something while I
          navigate this journey as well!</p>

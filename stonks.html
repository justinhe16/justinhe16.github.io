        <p> Hello Friends! This is my <u>stonks website</u> where I continually update my positions and my thoughts on the market. I will be keeping track of TWO accounts -- account one is a long term account with investments in longs and more fundamental plays, while account two is an agressive options-only account that does 50% long term plays and 50% mid/short term plays.
          Please note that <b> I am not a financial advisor </b> and none of the info on this site should be taken as financial advice. Do your own due dilligence and use this information at your own risk! </br>
        </br>
        The point of this site is <b>two things</b>:
        </br> a) keep track of my plays in order to improve my strategies across time
      </br> b) share my learning with my friends as I want all my friends to make tendies <p>

            <h2 class="card-title">2/01/21</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Overall a solid green day with decent hedging, many areas of improvement though!
            </br>
          </br>
          Today my first account flourished, with gains of <b> +$990 </b>, attributed to my ARK related holdings
          and other long term positions bringing in value as well, specifically <b> CCIV. </b> For this account, today I sold my ARK-related positions
          as I believe the entire market is entering a downtrend, so by selling my ARK positions I hope I captured/sold at a local top. This is also a good
          exit for me here so that way I can focus on reallocating into other industries as planned. No new positions were added in this account today.

          </br>
          </br>

          My second account did alright, taking a roughly <b> -$250 </b> loss on the day. My day trades which involved <b> $JMIA, $FUBO, $AMZN </b> actually did very well
          alongside some of the new swings I entered including <b> $MRNA, $SPY, $GME </b> puts netted some gains already as well. Most of my losses were from my medium-term
          butterflies, namely my SPY Put butterfly, as today SPY made a decent rebounce to the 377s area. As of today we are still bearish and respecting the downtrend. One thing
          I can work on is maintaining my conviction; today, I picked up $FUBO but ended up paper handing it for a small percentage gain because I thought I saw weakness in the name,
          but I could have accounted for that by studying $FUBO in previous sessions where it often demonstrates weakness early in the day and rallies later on. I missed out on many
          tendies as a result. My current positions include AMZN, LULU, and SPY for medium-term plays as well as some short term swing plays that include $SPY 369P for 2/3,
          $GME 20P, $MRNA 150P, $FSR 15.5C for 2/5, and $INO 18C for 2/12. Hoping to profit off of $AMZN earnings report as well as overall market downtrend soon!

        <div class="card recap">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">1/31/21</h2>
            <p class="card-text">What's up party people! This is my ~ first post ~ on the justinhe.com/stonks site. Let's get started :)
            </br>
          </br>
          Starting off with my monthly goals, for my 1st account I hope to <b>rebalance and refocus</b> my positions in order to make my
          exposure cleaner and more intentful, rather than bleeding into a variety of diverse positions. My goals are to move away from my heavy position in ARKK
          and reposition in materials, financials, weed as those are expected to be strong hitters in 2021 under Biden's administration. Additionally, I want to sell
          covered calls on these LEAPS. I may also want to dedicate 25% to 50% of this portfolio to the Wycoff accumulation trading strategy but I'm not fully decided;
          I'll make the call when I finish repositioning! Ideally, my goal for the end of the month of February is to hit ~10% mark on this account, so <b> $47124.00 </b>.
                      </br>
          </br>
          With my second account, I will be playing more aggressively. Currently, I am in some AMZN and LULU spreads, recommended by my mentor at LKS, and a SPY put spread, in anticpation for a correction.
          My goal after these resolve is to also rebalance and reposition into aggressive LEAPs and sell covered calls on those. Some of the growth tickers I am looking at are
          <b> TSM, NIO, BABA, CRON, GM, GRWG </b> which are high-growth, high-risk value stock. Additionally, I plan to continue adding my swing positions in <b> RIO, SRPT </b> as well as
          attempting various swing and day trades at <b> SLV, FUBO </b>. Ideally, my goal for the end of February is to hit a ~15% mark on this account, so roughly <b> $44000.00 </b>.
                      </br>
          </br>
          My day-of-the-week updates will be more specific and go indepth for each play I made that day -- thanks for following along and I hope you can learn something while I
          navigate this journey as well!</p>
